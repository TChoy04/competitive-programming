/*You have n rectangular wooden blocks, which are numbered from 1 to n. The i-th block is 1 unit high and ⌈i2⌉ units long.

Here, ⌈x2⌉ denotes the result of division of x by 2, rounded up. For example, ⌈42⌉=2 and ⌈52⌉=⌈2.5⌉=3.

For example, if n=5, then the blocks have the following sizes: 1×1, 1×1, 1×2, 1×2, 1×3.

The available blocks for n=5
Find the maximum possible side length of a square you can create using these blocks, without rotating any of them. Note that you don't have to use all of the blocks.

One of the ways to create 3×3 square using blocks 1 through 5
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤109) — the number of blocks.

Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible side length of a square you can create. */
