/*In order to write a string, Atilla needs to first learn all letters that are contained in the string.

Atilla needs to write a message which can be represented as a string s. He asks you what is the minimum alphabet size required so that one can write this message.

The alphabet of size x (1≤x≤26) contains only the first x Latin letters. For example an alphabet of size 4 contains only the characters a, b, c and d.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤100) — the length of the string.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum alphabet size required to so that Atilla can write his message s.*/
